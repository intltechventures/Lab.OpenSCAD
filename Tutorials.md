- OpenSCAD is a free, open-source software application for creating solid 3D CAD objects using its own description language. It is known for its intuitive syntax, which allows users to describe 3D objects as code, which can be organized in libraries and reused in various contexts. Unlike many CAD products, OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeler and focuses on the CAD aspects of 3D modeling.
